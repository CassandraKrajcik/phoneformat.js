##FAQ
####When will you update PhoneFormat.js to the latest version of libphonenumber?

Unfortunately I don't plan on updating this code very often.  More often then not PhoneFormat.js will NOT be using the [latest version](https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fjavascript%2Fi18n%2Fphonenumbers) of libphonenumber.  Not to worry because i'm going to show you just how easy it is for you to get PhoneFormat.js using the latest version of libphonenumber!

The real beauty of PhoneFormat.js is that everything is compressed into just one file with some easy to use helper functions I created for you.  I'll show you how to generate PhoneFormat.js using the latest version of libphonenumber in only 3 simple steps!
